  🧠 Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
  Predict diseases based on symptoms using advanced machine learning models. This project aims to support early diagnosis and aid healthcare systems with a robust, interpretable AI-based solution.

  📌 Overview
In today’s fast-paced world, diagnosing diseases early can make the difference between prevention and cure. This project uses a dataset with 132 symptoms and maps them to 42 distinct diseases, creating a powerful model capable of predicting diseases from user-input symptoms.

  🔍 Key Features
Predicts 42+ diseases using 132+ symptoms

Ensemble machine learning model using:

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine

Gaussian Naive Bayes

Final model based on majority voting

Cleaned, labeled, and preprocessed medical dataset

Visualizations like bar plots, word clouds, and heatmaps

Interactive prediction function for custom inputs

🧪 Dataset
🔢 Rows: 4920

🧬 Columns: 134 (132 binary symptoms + 1 prognosis + 1 unnamed)

🏷️ Target: prognosis (the disease label)

🚫 Nulls cleaned, categorical data encoded

🧠 Machine Learning Models
🔢 Preprocessing:

Label encoding of prognosis

Train-test split (80:20)

K-Fold Cross-Validation (k=10)

🧪 Algorithms Used:
